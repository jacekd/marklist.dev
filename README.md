marklist
========

Markdown blog'a'like. Simple app which scans the *application/views/md/* directory for markdown files, list and interprets them. 

Written in [Laravel](http://laravel.com) with [Sparkdown](http://bundles.laravel.com/bundle/sparkdown) bundle. Quick'n'diry but it does the job. 

## Usage
1. Point web server to public directory
2. Copy markdown [*md] files into *application/views/md/*
3. You are done!
